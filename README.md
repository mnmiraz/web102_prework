## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I had some trouble getting used to the flow of the code. I had to spend a good amount of time reading the links attached to each of the challenges. I particularly had a more challenging time with Challenge #7 and the optional work, but it was overall very rewarding to see the final product. I attempted to add the search bar functionality but could not finish the javascript logic in time.
